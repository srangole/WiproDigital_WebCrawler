I have used Java to write the code and used 3rd party jar(Jsoup) as a HTML parser, Whole project I have committed along with the lib so that project can be imported in eclipse to build and run.

How to run the project? I have added the ant file to build the project. Use ant build to compile the project and use the jar file generated in the build directory to run. java -jar WiproWebCrawler.jar
